7. **Pickup Location** â€“ 50 dummy areas from Bengaluru  
8. **Drop Location** â€“ Selected from dummy pickup locations  
9. **Avg VTAT** â€“ Time taken for the vehicle to arrive  
10. **Avg CTAT** â€“ Time taken for the customer to board  
11. **Cancelled Rides by Customer** â€“ Not exceeding **7%**  
12. **Reason for Cancelling by Customer**:  
   - Driver not moving towards pickup

   - Customer-related issues  
   - Customer was coughing/sick  
   - More than permitted passengers  
15. **Incomplete Rides** â€“ Less than **6%**  
16. **Incomplete Rides Reason**:  
   - Customer demand  
   - Vehicle breakdown  
   - Other issues  
17. **Booking Value** â€“  
   - **70%** of rides under â‚¹500  
   - **28%** between â‚¹500-â‚¹1000  
   - Remaining above â‚¹1000  
18. **Ride Distance** â€“ Variable based on booking type  
19. **Driver Ratings** â€“ Given for completed rides  
20. **Customer Ratings** â€“ Given for completed rides  

## **Additional Constraints**
